# ROBDD-Based-Equivalent-Checker

We were asked to design EC based on ROBDD, the input is 2 Boolean
functions and the output is ROBDD with Equivalent or Non Equivalent Results.

â€¢ The project includes:

o Ability to enter 2 Boolean Functions to your Engine

o Boolean Function Parser

o ROBDD Constructor

o ROBDD Comparator to result (Proof or Disproof)

o Graphical Creator for results 2 Functions ROBDD and Formal Results about
